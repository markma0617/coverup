You are an expert Python test-driven developer.
The code below, extracted from docstring_parser/attrdoc.py, does not achieve full coverage:
when tested, branch 61->69 does not execute.
Create new pytest test functions that execute these missing lines/branches, always making
sure that the tests are correct and indeed improve coverage.
Always send entire Python test scripts when proposing a new test or correcting one you
previously proposed.
Be sure to include assertions in the test that verify any applicable postconditions.
Please also make VERY SURE to clean up after the test, so as to avoid state pollution;
use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate.
Write as little top-level code as possible, and in particular do not include any top-level code
calling into pytest.main or the test itself.
Respond ONLY with the Python code enclosed in backticks, without any explanation.

```python
            def ast_get_attribute(
                node: ast.AST,
            ) -> T.Optional[T.Tuple[str, T.Optional[str], T.Optional[str]]]:
                """Return name, type and default if the given node is an attribute."""
                if isinstance(node, (ast.Assign, ast.AnnAssign)):
                    target = (
                        node.targets[0] if isinstance(node, ast.Assign) else node.target
                    )
        61:         if isinstance(target, ast.Name):
                        type_str = None
                        if isinstance(node, ast.AnnAssign):
                            type_str = ast_unparse(node.annotation)
                        default = None
                        if node.value:
                            default = ast_unparse(node.value)
                        return target.id, type_str, default
        69:     return None
